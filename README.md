# Electron, React with Material-UI design theme and SQLite with Sequelize


## Setup the project
Problem goes with the package `sqlite3`, which is native and need to be rebuild to be used with electron

* Install those packages
``` bash
npm install â€“g node-gyp
```
``` bash
npm install -g windows-build-tools # This package needs to be run from administrator console, also python is required
```

* Run this command to rebuild `sqlite3`
``` bash
npm run rebuild
```
If there are no errors, the project can be started


## Commands to use
* To start the project:
``` bash
npm start
```

* To use the Electron debug tool
execute the following from the Console tab of your running Electron app's developer tools:
``` javascript
require('devtron').install();
```

You should then see a Devtron tab added.
